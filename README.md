# my-hero-page

For this project I'll be creating an entire web page replicating a design. The design comes in 2 images: 

one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors.

The point of this project is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.
